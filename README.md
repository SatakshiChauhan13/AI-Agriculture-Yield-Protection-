# 🌾 AI in Agriculture: Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction

This project was developed as part of the **YBI FOUNDATION Internship**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on using **Artificial Intelligence** to help farmers by predicting **crop yield** based on input parameters such as:
- 🌧️ Rainfall
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 🌱 Soil Quality

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

## 🗂️ Dataset

For demonstration purposes, a small synthetic dataset was created. You can replace it with real-world agricultural datasets (from Kaggle, FAO, etc.) for better accuracy.

## 📊 Key Steps in the Project

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model training using **Linear Regression**  
4. Prediction and result visualization  
5. Model evaluation using **R² Score** and **MSE**

## ✅ Results

- The model can successfully predict crop yield based on environmental inputs.
- Helpful for improving decision-making in agriculture.

## 💼 Internship Info

This project was completed under the **YBI Foundation Internship Program** in July 2025.
